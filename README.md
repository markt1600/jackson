# The Drip Atelier

A generative drip-painting studio in the manner of Jackson Pollock. Pure static
HTML/JS — no build step, no dependencies, ready for Vercel.

## Features
- **Physically simulated pours** — the engine models the artist's hand moving
  above the canvas with a viscous paint string dangling from the stick on a
  damped spring (paint can't turn corners: every wrist jerk becomes a curve or
  whip-loop). Paint parcels leave the string, fly ballistically under real
  gravity scaled to the canvas's physical size, and land carried ahead of the
  hand. Line weight follows mass conservation (w ∝ √(Q/v)); above each paint's
  breakup speed the filament tears Rayleigh-style into scattered droplet
  trails with impact-stretched drops; energetic impacts throw forward crown
  splatter; hovering pools paint into anchored discs with beaded rims and
  settled grit; fresh lines crossing still-wet paint drag and marble both
  colours. Plus colour drifting along each skein and cast shadows.
- **Impasto relief & varnish** — every mark also raises a half-resolution
  height field whose base is the canvas weave itself. When the pour is done,
  a varnish-and-lighting pass relaxes the field (wet paint smooths), then
  lights it with a real shading model: surface normals with Lambertian
  diffuse, tight Blinn-Phong glints on the wet enamel, cast shadows (every
  rope shadows the canvas on its down-light side via an occlusion march
  toward the light), and contact ambient occlusion at rope bases and in
  crevices. Bare canvas stays matte cloth, thin passages let the weave show
  through, heavy ropes bury it. The key light's angle varies per painting
  (aluminium shimmer follows it). The finished picture is then photographed
  in the gallery: a museum track light rakes from the key corner, a soft
  spot blooms there, and the corners fall quiet — depth from shadow, never
  a white veil.
- **Material texture** — enamel on raw canvas wicks oil outward, so every
  rope, droplet and pool blooms a faint warm stain halo into the cloth.
  The finishing pass settles studio debris (dust, fibres, the odd nib) into
  the paint, lays per-pixel pigment-and-sensor grain over everything, and
  adds two octaves of cloudy mottle — the soft unevenness of ageing, gloss
  and light. The ground itself carries weave, slubs, tonal blotches, and
  soiled, handled edges.
- **Washes & webs** — beyond lines, the engine throws two more mark
  families from the late drip paintings: broad thin *washes* (irregular
  soaked stains with mottled bodies, feathered bleeding edges, pigment
  gathering at the drying rim, often chaining into larger complexes — and
  thin enough that the weave reads through them). Nearly half of the
  heavier washes go down as *impasto*: buttery thick bodies that raise the
  height field across their whole area, with knife-drag striations carved
  along one direction into both the colour and the relief — grooves for
  the raking light to catch, crest glints where the gloss peaks, and
  longer cast shadows thrown by the taller paint and *webs* (bursts of
  long fine threads sweeping arcs around a region, the dense hairline
  netting of works like Convergence). Lines crossing wet washes drag and
  marble. Palettes interleave masses, webbing and threadwork in the layer
  orders of the originals — and the session itself is interleaved in time:
  every action is stamped with a moment in the session (its colour's phase
  plus a wide spread, with occasional returns to an earlier can) and the
  whole plan is sorted by that clock, so no colour ever arrives as a single
  stratum. Black runs under one red mass and over the next, the way the
  painter actually circled the canvas.
- **Aluminium paint** — Lavender Veil and Blue Poles carry a metallic
  aluminium layer (as the originals did) whose flake catches the key light:
  strokes angled toward it flare bright, strokes across it fall to darker
  grey.
- **Live painting, paced** — a fresh painting unfolds over ~3 seconds so you
  can watch it develop layer by layer; regenerate at any moment with
  **Pour a new painting** (mid-generation regeneration cancels cleanly).
  Rehanging from the ledge is near-instant. Respects prefers-reduced-motion.
- **High resolution** — renders at 4,400 px on the long edge offscreen;
  the on-screen view is a scaled preview of the same pixels.
- **Formats** — Square, Classic 3:2, Panorama, Portrait.
- **Palettes** — five, each named for and tuned to one of the famous drip
  paintings: Convergence (the default), One: No. 31, Lavender Mist,
  Blue Poles, and Number 32 (black enamel on cream).
- **Presentation** — naked canvas, gallery black/white, natural oak, or museum
  gold, each with a linen liner. The chosen frame is composited into the
  download at full resolution with mitred corners, an inner shadow, and real
  material texture clipped inside each side: long wavy grain and the
  occasional knot in the oak, gold leaf laid in squares with seams, patina
  and red bole wearing through at the corners, brushed satin black, warm
  gesso white — all under a carved profile with a burnished outer ridge and
  shadowed inner step. Every frame carries its own seeded wear: scuffs and
  fine scratches, nicks bitten out of the outer edge, softly worn corners,
  and per-style flaws (flaked gold leaf baring the red bole, yellowed
  gesso, satin rubbed bright where it's gripped, pale chips at the oak
  mitres). The on-screen frame is painted by the same code with the same
  per-piece seed as the download — what you see is exactly what you save.
- **Download** — one-click PNG export, named after the piece.
- **The ledge** — the five most recent finished works rest on a rail below
  the wall; click one to rehang it instantly. Works are stored as tiny
  *recipes* (seed + format + palette) plus a thumbnail, never pixels, and
  regenerate pixel-identically. Where the host provides shared storage
  (window.storage — e.g. running as a Claude artifact) the ledge is
  **communal**: it holds the five most recent pours by *anyone* visiting
  the atelier, refreshed every 30 s, with save-time merging so nobody's
  fresh pour is clobbered — and the app tells visitors that the ledge and
  their titles are public. On Vercel, the bundled `/api/ledge` serverless
  function provides the same communal behaviour: the front end probes it
  once at boot and, if healthy, switches to remote mode (server-side merge
  on save, 30 s refresh). Anywhere neither is available it falls back to
  this browser's localStorage (guarded — session-only memory where even
  that is unavailable).

### Enabling the communal ledge on Vercel

1. Deploy the folder as-is — `api/ledge.js` ships with it (no npm deps).
2. In the Vercel dashboard, add an **Upstash for Redis** store from the
   Marketplace (formerly Vercel KV) and connect it to the project. The
   `KV_REST_API_URL` / `KV_REST_API_TOKEN` env vars (or the `UPSTASH_*`
   pair — both are honoured) appear automatically; redeploy.
3. Done. Without a store the endpoint answers 503 and every visitor simply
   keeps a private localStorage ledge — nothing breaks.

The endpoint sanitises every write (whitelisted formats/palettes, numeric
seed, 48-char titles, image-only thumbnails capped at 150 KB) and the
ledge itself is capped at five entries server-side.
  No server needed; cross-device storage would require Vercel KV/Blob + an API
  route.
- **Naming** — click the title on the museum placard to rename a piece; the
  name follows it onto the ledge and into the download filename.
- Five enamel palettes inspired by the classic canon. Each work gets a museum
  placard with a generated title and physical dimensions.

## Deploy to Vercel
Any of these:

1. **Dashboard:** vercel.com → Add New → Project → import this folder's repo
   (or drag-and-drop the folder on a Hobby plan). Framework preset: **Other**.
   No build command, output directory: root.
2. **CLI:**
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   vercel --prod
   ```

That's it — `index.html` is the whole app.

## Local preview
```bash
npx serve .
# or just open index.html in a browser
```
